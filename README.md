## üìù Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Email Validation
- Validates the email format using regex pattern matching.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Parse Email Components
- Splits the email into `username` and `domain` (e.g., `john.doe` and `company.com`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Person Name (4 strategies, fallback chain)
1. **Strategy 1:** Parse username structure (common patterns like `first.last`, `first_last`).  
2. **Strategy 2:** Use **spaCy NLP** to recognize named entities in the username.  
3. **Strategy 3:** Scrape the company website's team/leadership pages.  
4. **Strategy 4:** Search **DuckDuckGo** for company leadership information.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Domain Type (Classification)
- Checks if it‚Äôs a known free email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, ProtonMail, etc.).  
- If not, uses **GloVe word embeddings** to determine if domain is a university or company.  
- Applies keyword matching and domain suffix rules as fallbacks.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identify University (if applicable)
- Checks against a database of 100+ known universities.  
- Uses keyword patterns (e.g., `.edu`, `.ac.uk`, `.ac.in`).  
- Scrapes websites for university indicators.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Find Related Company (if applicable)
- Scrapes the company website to extract official company name.  
- Retrieves meta descriptions and structured data.  
- Falls back to domain-based naming if scraping fails.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Classify Business Sector
- Analyzes website content for industry keywords.  
- Categorizes into: Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Manufacturing, Consulting, Education, Media, Energy, or Real Estate.  
- Uses fallback search if website analysis doesn‚Äôt work.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Return Enriched Data
- All findings are compiled into a structured **JSON object** with confidence scores.
